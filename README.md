# ESLINT Configuration for Coldrye Projects

Shared eslint configuration for all coldrye projects.

Above all, this one enforces the ALLMAN brace-style and establishes some rather
strict rules to enforce a clean coding style.

This might not be everybody's cup of tea, especially more so since a lot of
rules have not been established yet as this is a WIP.
